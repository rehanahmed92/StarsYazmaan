        Our aspirations for excellence met many adversaries on its way. The journey that we started (1992) <br>
        with a single step has covered a long distance in a short span of time. We accelerated our momentum <br>
        without any compromise on the quality edification standards and knowledge dissemination process. <br>
        We have developed a distinctive academic culture, uncommon in other private institutes of learning. <br>
        This was only possible because of our firm belief in the Almighty Allah and unshakable confidence <br>
        in our noble cause for educating the nation, which helped us to overcome apparently insurmountable obstacles
        <br>
        amicably. On our way to perfection, we have been shown fabulous and history making results in the recent years
        <br>
        among all over Punjab. <br>
